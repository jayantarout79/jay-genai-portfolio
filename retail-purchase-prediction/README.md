Perfect 👌 — let’s create a polished README.md for your GitHub repo. It should explain the project clearly to recruiters/peers and set you up for a LinkedIn post later.

Here’s a structure tailored to your Retail Purchase Prediction (Random Forest) project:

⸻

🛒 Retail Purchase Prediction using Random Forest

This project predicts whether an online shopper will make a purchase (Revenue = True/False) using behavioral session data. The goal is to help businesses target high-likelihood buyers while minimizing wasted discounts and marketing spend.

⸻

📂 Dataset
	•	Source: UCI Online Shoppers Intention Dataset
	•	Rows: ~12,330 sessions
	•	Columns: 18 features (session behavior, page values, traffic source, etc.)
	•	Target: Revenue (True = purchase, False = no purchase)
	•	Class balance: Imbalanced → ~85% False, ~15% True

⸻

🎯 Business Problem

Companies often give discounts/promotions broadly, leading to wasted spend.
This project asks:

“Can we predict if a customer session will likely result in a purchase, so we only offer incentives to high-probability buyers?”

⸻

⚙️ Approach
	1.	Preprocessing
	•	Handled categorical features (Month, VisitorType, OS, Browser, Region, TrafficType) with OneHotEncoding
	•	Numeric features (e.g., ProductRelated_Duration, PageValues, ExitRates) kept as continuous
	•	Converted Weekend → binary (0/1)
	•	Built a sklearn Pipeline to combine preprocessing + model
	2.	Modeling
	•	Baseline: Decision Tree (to understand splits/overfitting)
	•	Main: Random Forest Classifier
	•	Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV + StratifiedKFold
	•	Parameters tuned: max_depth, min_samples_leaf, min_samples_split, max_features, n_estimators, class_weight
	3.	Evaluation
	•	Split into Train (70%) / Validation (10%) / Test (20%)
	•	Metrics tracked: Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC
	•	Chose precision as primary metric → minimize wasted offers

⸻

📊 Results

Best Hyperparameters (GridSearchCV):

{
  "max_depth": 6,
  "min_samples_leaf": 10,
  "min_samples_split": 2,
  "max_features": "sqrt",
  "n_estimators": 200,
  "class_weight": null
}

Validation Metrics (Threshold = 0.50):
	•	Precision: 1.00
	•	Recall: 0.15
	•	F1: 0.25
	•	ROC-AUC: 0.92

Interpretation:
	•	Model predicts with very high precision — if it says a user will buy, they almost always do.
	•	Recall is lower — many buyers are missed.
	•	Business trade-off: saves money by targeting only “sure buyers,” but loses some potential buyers.

⸻

🔑 Key Lessons
	1.	Precision vs Recall trade-off is critical → business context decides which to prioritize.
	2.	Class imbalance matters → balanced weights tested, but precision-focused model without weights worked better.
	3.	Feature importance showed PageValues, ProductRelated_Duration, and ExitRates as top drivers.
	4.	GridSearchCV with multiple metrics gave a better view than a single metric.
	5.	Pipelines make preprocessing + training reproducible and production-ready.

⸻

📌 Next Steps
	•	Tune decision thresholds for different business needs (e.g., higher recall if maximizing sales).
	•	Experiment with XGBoost/LightGBM for better recall.
	•	Deploy as a simple Flask/Streamlit app to test real-time prediction.

⸻

🖥️ Tech Stack
	•	Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
	•	sklearn Pipeline + GridSearchCV
	•	Jupyter Notebooks for EDA + modeling
